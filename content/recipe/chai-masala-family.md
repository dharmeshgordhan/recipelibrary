## Ingredients

- {{<c>}}¼ cup black peppercorns
- {{<c>}}¼ cup white peppercorns
- {{<c>}}¼ dried ginger
- {{<c>}}seeds from 20 green cardamom pods
- {{<c>}}3 inch cinnamon stick
- {{<c>}}20 cloves
- {{<c>}}¼ tsp grated nutmeg

## Notes

Spices vary in strength. Particularly if they're not so fresh. Unfortunately, I lack mum's experience to smell a batch, and suggest what it needs. One day we'll be that good...

We tend to use the cardamom seeds, and toss the shells into the final mix after its toasted. 

## Prep

In a spice grinder, grind all the ingredients together to a somewhat fine powder. 

Toast the powder in a pan until they darken in colour. Colour will depend on the spices... 

Allow to cool.

Store in an airtight container once cool.

## Making chai

To 1 teacup portion of water, add 1 tsp of tea leaves, ¼ tsp of masala. Optionally you can add: a small cutting of lemongrass, a couple of mint leaves, 1 tsp sugar etc. Add your optionals at the start if you can. Bring to a boil. Add fridge cold milk. Bring to a boil again. Take it off the heat. Strain and serve.
