## Prep

Heat the oil. Gently simmar the onions. Fry the harissa in the oil. Fry the tomato puree and garlic. Add the sugar, bay leaves, cumin, tomatos and salt. Simmer uncovered until cooked thru. Put a lid if it runs low on liquid. Can cook for 30mins - ideally 3 hours - up to you :)

Make 4 small wells in the sauce. Crack the eggs into the wells. Cook gently til eggs are cooked, then serve. Throw some chopped corriander on top.
