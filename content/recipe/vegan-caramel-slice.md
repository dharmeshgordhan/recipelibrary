> _...without having to resort to making the an layer out of soggy dates ... but dates masquerading as caramels_...

Agreed ðŸ˜†. while I appreciate making something vegan, dates and caramel have a different taste. A 'caramel' slice with dates for the caramel... is a date slice...

Line a 20cm baking tray.

Caramel: place the coconut cream in a medium saucepan over a medium heat. Add the sugar and stir until dissolved. Adjust the heat - get a low boil. Let it boil for 30mins. Stir periodically.

While the coconut cream is condensing, time to make crumble. Put the biscuits in the food processor, blitz. Then add the rest of the ingredients. Blitz to a fine crumb. It should hold when squished. Fill the tray and squash the crumble down firmly and evenly.Refridgerate.

After 30 minutes, check on the cream. Depending on your saucepan and the heat - it may be done. When it has reduced by half you should have about 2 cups. It should look creamy and syrupy.

In a small cup, mix the cornflour and water to a slurry.

Add the cashew butter, dairy-free spread, brown sugar, syrup slurry, vanilla and salt to a saucepan. Stir vigicuny for a minute until melted and combined. Bring to a low boil, stir until thickened.

Set aside to cool (20 minutes), then pour over the base and refridgerate for > 4 hrs.

Topping: mix the chopped chocolate and coconut in a bowl. Microwave on high for 1 minute. Stir to combine. If it needs it, keep heating in 30 second busts. Spread on top of the slice and refridgerate for 1 hr.

Slide into squares. Store in an air tight container in the fridge. It will soften at room temperature.
