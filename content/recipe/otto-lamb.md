- {{<c>}} 1 teaspoon fennel seeds

- {{<c>}} 1 star anise
- {{<c>}} ½ cinnamon stick
- {{<c>}} 1 tablespoon grated nutmeg, about half a pod
- {{<c>}} ¼ teaspoon ground ginger
- {{<c>}} 1 tablespoon sweet paprika
- {{<c>}} 1 tablespoon dried sumac
- {{<c>}} ¾ tablespoon kosher salt
- {{<c>}} 1 3-inch piece of fresh ginger, peeled and grated
- {{<c>}} 3 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed
- {{<c>}} ¾ cup chopped cilantro, stems and leaves included
- {{<c>}} 4 tablespoons fresh-squeezed lemon juice
- {{<c>}} ½ cup peanut or other neutral oil
- {{<c>}} 1 leg of lamb, on the bone, about 5 1/2-6 1/2 pounds

## Prep

### Step 1
Dry roast the: peppercorns, cloves, cardamom, fenugreek, fennel, cumin, star anise and cinnamon for a minute or two, until the spices begin to pop and release their aromas. Take care not to burn them. 

Add the nutmeg, ground ginger and paprika, and toss for a few more seconds, just to heat them. 

Transfer everything to a spice grinder. Process the spices into powder. Transfer to a bowl, and stir in the sumac, salt, fresh ginger, garlic, cilantro, lemon juice and oil.

### Step 2
Score the leg of lamb in a few places. Make half-inch-deep slits through the fat and meat. Put the lamb in a roasting dish, rub the marinade all over it. Turn the lamb fat-side up, cover with aluminum foil and let it marinate for 2 hours, ideally overnight.

### Step 3
Heat oven to 175 C. Remove the aluminum foil, and place the lamb in the oven. Roast for approximately 4 1/2 hours, or until the meat is completely tender. After 30 minutes of roasting, add about a cup of boiling water to the pan. Use this liquid to baste the meat every hour or so. (Add more water if needed). After 90 minutes or so, cover the lamb with aluminum foil to prevent the spices from burning. Once done, let the lamb rest for 15mins before serving.
