## Ingredients

- {{<c>}}200g dark chocolate, chopped
- {{<c>}}50g butter, chopped
- {{<c>}}4 eggs
- {{<c>}}½ cup sugar
- {{<c>}}2 tsps vanilla extract
- {{<c>}}¼ cup flour, sifted
- {{<c>}}1 tbsp cocoa, sifted


## Prep

1. Preheat oven to 180C. Spray a 6-hole large muffin pan with oil.

2. Place the chocolate and butter in a bowl and microwave on high for 1 minute. Stir until melted. Set aside. 

3. Beat the eggs and sugar with an electric beater until pale and thick, about 5 minutes. Add the vanilla, flour and cocoa and beat for another two minutes.

4. Add the chocolate and butter mixture and beat for a further 5 minutes. (This mixture needs a lot of beating to incorporate air and make the puddings light.)

5. Spoon the mixture into the muffin pan to three-quarters full and bake for 10 minutes – the puddings should be very soft or gooey to touch. Carefully remove from the pan and place on individual plates.
