> Many cookies use coconut oil. I really try to avoid coconut as a base as I feel it introduces a strong coconut taste - which can be fine - but I really don't like coconut _everywere_. You need to put coconut in the name if it tastes so strongly of coconut.

## Ingredients

- {{<c>}}2½ cups of all purpose flour 
- {{<c>}}2 tsp baking soda
- {{<c>}}½ salt
- {{<c>}}200g smooth cashew butter
- {{<c>}}50g nut milk
- {{<c>}}2 tbsp ground ginger
- {{<c>}}1 tsp ground cinnamon
- {{<c>}}¼ tsp ground cloves
- {{<c>}}¼ tsp ground pepper
- {{<c>}}pinch of cayenne
- {{<c>}}250g brown sugar
- {{<c>}}¼ cup molasses
- {{<c>}}2 tbsp fresh ginger
- {{<c>}}1 large egg + 1 large yolk
- {{<c>}}100g granulated sugar (optional)

## Prep

Whisk flour, baking soda and salt together. 

Heat the cashew butter and milk together until bubbles appear and the mixture is combined and smooth. Take off the heat. Add the ground ginger, cinnamon, cloves, pepper and cayenne. Let it cool slightly. Then add the brown sugar, molasses, and fresh ginger - and whisk to combine. Add the eggs and whisk.

Add the flour until just combined.

Refridgerate the dough for at least 1 hour.

Preheat the oven to 150C. 

Portion out and roll the dough into 1 inch balls. Roll this in the granulated sugar. Place on a lined baking tray.

Bake for 20-25 minutes - until the cookies start to darken.

Allow to cool.
