## Prep

Four small glasses or rammikins ready for the mousse.
Make space in your fridge.

Chop the chocolate up finely on a clean dry chopping board. Transfer to heatproof bowl. 

Set the bowl over a saucepan with a little gently simmering water. Place bowl over the water for few minutes until you can see that the chocolate has started to melt then gently stir every now and the until smooth.

Add the just-boiled water and stir it through. Remove the bowl from the pan and leave it to cool slightly while you beat the aquafaba.

Pour me aquafaba to a large mixing bowl. Beat with an electric beater on high speed for about five minutes until you have a lovely thick, pillowy dough like meringue. When you place the bowl upside down, the fluff should stay put.

Fold out a cup of the whipped aquafaba through the melted chocolate to aerate it.

Now, scrape the aerated chocolate mixture into the bowl containing the remaining aquafaba, and fold lightly and lovingly with saptula until evenly combined - a light brown pillowy mass. If your mixture seems a little running at this point don't despair it wll sill set.

Ladie or pour the mixture into the prepared disse andrafnge about 4 hours to set.

When ready to serve, sprinkle with finely chopped chocolate and cocoa.
