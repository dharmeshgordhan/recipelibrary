- {{<c>}}¾ cup plain flour

- {{<c>}}¼ cup golden syrup
- {{<c>}}¾ cup soft brown sugar
- {{<c>}}¼ cup coconut oil
- {{<c>}}1 tsp vanilla extract
- {{<c>}}2 tsp ground ginger
- {{<c>}}¼ tsp salt

### Icing

- {{<c>}}2 ½ cups desiccated coconut
- {{<c>}}½ cup dairy-free spread
- {{<c>}}3 tbsp coconut oil
- {{<c>}}3 tbsp golden syrup
- {{<c>}}2 tbsp ground ginger
- {{<c>}}½ tsp salt
- {{<c>}}2¼ cups icing sugar
- {{<c>}}¼ cup boiling water

### To finish

- {{<c>}}2-3 tbspn buckwheat groats
- {{<c>}}crystalised ginger

## Prep

Preheat the ocen to 180C. Line a 20m tray with baking paper, up and over the sides.

Place the oats, coconut, flour, buckwheat and stir to combine evenly. Put the syrup, sugar, coconut oil, vanilla, ginger and salt in a saucepan over a medium heat until just melted. Add the oat mixture.

Tip into the tin, and squish into an even layer. Bake for 15 minutes, and allow to cool.

To make the coconut butter: place the coconut in a food processor. Process on high for about 10 minutes. Scrap down the sides once or trice. It will turn into a buttery paste eventually. Scrape the coconut butter into a medium-sized saucepan. Add the dairy free spread, coconut oil, syrup, ginger and salt. Stir until melted. Next add the icing sugar. Pour in the just-boiled water and mix with a whisk. Spread on the base and smooth out. Sprinkle with buckwheat and crystalled ginger. Refrigerate for an hour.
