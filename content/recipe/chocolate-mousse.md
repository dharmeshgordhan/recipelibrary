## Prep

Prep four vessels for the mousse.

Chop the chocolate.

Melt the chocolate over a bain-marie. 

Add the boiled water to the melted chocolate and stir. Remove the bowl from the heat and leave it to cool while you beat the aquafaba.

Pour the aquafaba to a large mixing bowl. Beat on high speed for about five minutes. Beat until you have a thick, pillowy dough like meringue. When you place the bowl upside down, the fluff should stay put.

Fold a cup of the aquafaba through the melted chocolate to aerate it.

Scrape the aerated chocolate mixture into the bowl containing the remaining aquafaba, and fold lightly with a saptula until combined - a light pillowy mixture. If your mixture seems a runny don't worry it wll sill set.

Ladie the mixture into the prepared dishes and refridgerate for about 4 hours to set.

When ready to serve, sprinkle with finely chopped chocolate and cocoa.
