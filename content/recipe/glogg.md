## Ingredients

- {{<c>}}½ cup brown sugar
- {{<c>}}½ cup water
- {{<c>}}750ml bottle of wine (cab sav)
- {{<c>}}500ml port
- {{<c>}}1 cup of brandy
- {{<c>}}10 whole cardamon pods
- {{<c>}}sticks of cinnamon 
- {{<c>}}4 whole cloves
- {{<c>}}2 tsp vanilla extract
- {{<c>}}zest of 1 orange

### To serve

- {{<c>}}1 cup of raisins or sultanas
- {{<c>}}½ cup of toasted almonds

## Prep

Place the sugar and water in a saucepan and simmer over a med heat until the sugar is dissolved. Let it cool slightly.

Add the remaining ingredients. 

Reduce the heat. You want to get the the mix hot, but not let it simmer. If it gets too hot, all the alcohol will evaporate and you'll have virgin glogg. lol.

Leave it on a low heat for 30 minutes, until the aromatics have had time to diffuse into the alcohol stew. 

Sieve out the ginger and other spices.

To serve, ladle hot glögg into small glasses (you don't need much a few sultanas and almonds to the glass).

### Tips

If you have some cheesecloth or muslin, you can put the spices on and up into a little bag Then you can remove it at the end.

* To toast almonds, bake at 180°C for 5 minutes or so until golden.
