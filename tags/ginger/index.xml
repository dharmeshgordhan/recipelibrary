      <description>Many cookies use coconut oil. I really try to avoid coconut as a base as I feel it introduces a strong coconut taste - which can be fine - but I really don&amp;rsquo;t like coconut everywere. You need to put coconut in the name if it tastes so strongly of coconut.
 Ingredients  2½ cups of all purpose flour 2 tsp baking soda ½ salt 200g smooth cashew butter 50g nut milk 2 tbsp ground ginger 1 tsp ground cinnamon ¼ tsp ground cloves ¼ tsp ground pepper pinch of cayenne 250g brown sugar ¼ cup molasses 2 tbsp fresh ginger 1 large egg + 1 large yolk 100g granulated sugar (optional)  Prep Whisk flour, baking soda and salt together.</description>
